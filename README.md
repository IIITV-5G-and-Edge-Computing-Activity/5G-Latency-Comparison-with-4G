**Project Abstract**

This project aims to evaluate and compare the latency performance of 5G and 4G networks to assess the advancements in response times provided by 5G technology. Focusing on metrics such as round-trip time (RTT), upload latency, and download latency, the study analyzes performance across diverse use cases like gaming, video streaming, and video calls under varying conditions of signal strength and network load. Real-world data collected from devices supporting both networks is analyzed statistically to identify improvements and limitations. The findings provide insights into 5G's role in enhancing user experiences and supporting latency-critical applications.

**Methodology**

This study follows a systematic approach to evaluate and compare the latency performance of 4G and 5G networks across multiple real-world use cases. The methodology involves:

1. **Data Collection:**
   * Using Wireshark to capture network traffic for various use cases on devices supporting both 4G and 5G.
   * Capturing packet details like RTT, upload latency, and download latency.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   * Processing captured .pcap files to extract relevant latency metrics.
   * Visualizing the data using graphs and charts to compare 4G and 5G performance.
   * Employing statistical methods to compute mean, median, standard deviation, and percentage improvements.

3. **Validation and Enhancements:**
   * Conducting multiple tests to account for network variations.
   * Considering factors like signal strength and time of day for comprehensive analysis.

**Results**

The results demonstrate that 5G significantly outperforms 4G in most latency-related scenarios, especially for high-bandwidth applications like video streaming, gamingand downloads. However, in certain cases like idle, 4G showed slightly better performance.
