# 5G-Latency-Comparison-with-4G

## Objective  
This project measures, analyzes, and compares the latency performance of 5G and 4G networks under various scenarios to evaluate the improvements in response times offered by 5G technology.

---

## Scope of Work  
The study focuses on key latency metrics under varied conditions and use cases:  
- **Metrics Analyzed**:  
  - Round-trip time (RTT)  
  - Upload latency  
  - Download latency  

- **Use Cases Considered**:  
  - Video streaming  
  - Online gaming  
  - Video calls  
  - Web browsing  

- **Variable Conditions**:  
  - Signal strength variations  
  - Network load levels  

---

## Steps Involved  

### 1. Data Collection  
- **Devices**:  
  Use devices with both 4G and 5G capabilities.  
- **Environment**:  
  Test under controlled and real-world conditions for consistency.  
- **Tools**:  
  Network performance measurement tools (e.g., ping tests, iPerf, traceroute).  

### 2. Use Case Simulation  
- Simulate real-world scenarios to mimic typical user interactions.  
  - **Video Streaming**: Measure buffering times, bitrate consistency.  
  - **Gaming**: Evaluate latency spikes, responsiveness.  
  - **Video Calls**: Analyze call initiation and voice/video synchronization delays.  
  - **Web Browsing**: Measure page load times.  

### 3. Vary Conditions  
- Test under different signal strength levels: strong, medium, weak.  
- Simulate network congestion to evaluate performance under load.  

### 4. Data Analysis  
- Aggregate and analyze collected data to determine average, minimum, and maximum latency.  
- Compare the performance of 4G vs. 5G for each metric and scenario.  

### 5. Reporting  
- Create visualizations (graphs, charts) to represent the results.  
- Summarize findings and highlight key insights.
